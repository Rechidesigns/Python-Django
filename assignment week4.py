###  Work on the guessing game we did in class and allow the user to keep playing until they decide to stop. To do this,
# you need to ask the user to select if they want to play again after a number of trials. Also, if the user gets the correct guess at a trial,
# give the user a score point and an extra trial. However, if the user fails to get the correct guess, reduce the trial.
